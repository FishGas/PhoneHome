PhoneHomeTest
=============

This is a sample Android application that uses the PhoneHome API.  This particular version interacts with the sample backend provided in samples/backend.  Notice that it enables/disables PhoneHome by checking eligibility and then implements an example log sink to send the logs to our backend.
